                    <p>Linux is similar to other operating systems you may have used before, including Windows, macOS or iOS (Android is based on a modified Linux<a class="underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)">kernel</a>). Like other operating systems, Linux has a graphical interface and the same types of software you can find on all your other devices. In many cases, a software creator may have made a Linux version of the same program you use on other operating systems. Linus Torvalds created Linux in 1991. He was a student at the University of Helsinki. He built Linux as a free and open-source alternative to Minix, an operating system used in an academic setting.</p>

                    <p>Since Linux is open source, there are tons of Linux distributions (abbreviated as distro) that cater to different needs. Linux distributions are operating systems made from the Linux kernel and often a package management system. Linux Distributions can be seen as different flavours of Linux, as choosing one is up to personal preference. For example, there are Linux distributions for amateurs, hackers, programmers, servers, distributions for ancient computers, etc. There is a Linux distribution for everyone!</p>

                                    <td>One of the primary features of Linux is that it is open-source, meaning that its source code is easily available for everyone. Anyone can contribute, modify, improve and distribute the code to anyone and for any purpose.</td>

                                    <td>Linux is more secure compared to operating systems like Windows. Although Linux may be secure, it is not entirely immune to malware; it is less vulnerable than others. This is because every Linux program needs authorization from the administrator in order to be executed. Additionally, malicious files on Linux can be more easily removed. On Linux, system-related files are owned by the &ldquo;root&rdquo; superuser. If infected, viruses can be removed with ease as they can only affect the user account where they were installed, not the root account.

                                    <td>As the operating systems evolve, their hardware requirements increase exponentially. Windows 10 is a prime example. You will have to meet the minimum hardware requirements to run Windows 10, and even if you do meet them, there is no guarantee that it will run smoothly. On the other hand, with Linux, you can use as little as 256 MB of RAM coupled with an outdated processor to achieve a functional (although not optimal) operating system. Linux distributions are fitted for a wide range of systems (low-end or high-end). Suppose you compare a high-end Linux system and a high-end Windows-powered system. The Linux distribution will take the edge, which is why most of the servers across the world run on Linux instead of a Windows hosting environment.</td>

                                    <td>Another significant advantage of using Linux is its customizability. You can modify any feature according to your need as Linux is open source. Additionally, you can install themes, icon packs, and display system information on the desktop in the coolest way possible.</td>

There are a lot of active Linux users who are always ready to respond to any Linux questions or issues you may have&#8212;no more scratching your head for hours because something won&#39;t work! Within minutes of posting a thread, you may expect a reply and a detailed solution at no cost! Not to forget, you can just search for a similar thread on the web for a solution instead.</td>

Your Linux system rarely slows down or freezes, meaning you can keep your Linux machine on for days or even weeks without rebooting. As for windows, your PC will tend to become slower the longer the uptime. This is also why most webservers and supercomputers run Linux.</td>
